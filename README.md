# fsxNet Infopack

fsxNet is a fun, simple and experimental network established in late 2015.

fsxNet is not a prescriptive network. e[X]perimentation is at heart
of its name and members are actively encouraged to be creative in their
use of the network. Only a handfull of message areas and file bases are
used - setup is quick and [S]imple.

Technologies covered by the network include (but are not limited to)
BBSing, ANSI art, Amateur (HAM) Radio, Retro / Vintage Computers & Gaming,
FTN communications, network protocols & topologies, encryption methods,
contemporary computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi), computer coding and more.

fsxNet sees a number of messages posted to it every week. It is an
active support network for Mystic BBS software. It is also a proud
supporter of developers of other BBS software spanning BBS systems,
door games and more.

fsxNet is not an invite-only closed network, rather it is an open 
community and everyone who wishes to join is welcome.

Do you find it [F]un to learn about and use retro computing technologies?
Would you like to be part of a group that enjoy experimenting and developing
those technologies further? If the answer is yes, then we invite you to 
join us :)

The Infopack contains rego form, latest nodelist and more.
