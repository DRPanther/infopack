             fsxNet - [F]un, [S]imple, e[X]perimental Network

                               (Zone 21)
 
= Introducing fsxNet ========================================================
	
fsxNet is a fun, simple and experimental network established in late 2015

fsxNet is not a prescriptive network. e[X]perimentation is at heart
of its name and members are actively encouraged to be creative in their
use of the network. Only a handfull of message areas and file bases are
used - setup is quick and [S]imple.

Technologies covered by the network include (but are not limited to)
BBSing, ANSI art, Amateur (HAM) Radio, Retro / Vintage Computers & Gaming,
FTN communications, network protocols & topologies, encryption methods,
contemporary computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi), computer coding and more.

fsxNet sees a number of messages posted to it every week. It is an
active support network for Mystic BBS software. It is also a proud
supporter of developers of other BBS software spanning BBS systems,
door games and more.

fsxNet is not an invite-only closed network, rather it is an open 
community and everyone who wishes to join is welcome.

Do you find it [F]un to learn about and use retro computing technologies?
Would you like to be part of a group that enjoy experimenting and developing
those technologies further? If the answer is yes, then we invite you to 
join us :) 

== Goals ====================================================================

* Develop and encourage international communications between 100 (or more)
  geographically diverse bulletin board systems.

* Support and create learning and experimental opportunities between
  members.

* Foster borderless international friendships.

* Explore and develop new and interesting methods of online communication
  between members.
  
* A network based on having fun, while being respectful and helpful to each
  other.

== Housekeeping =============================================================

* Members of fsxNet are to conduct themselves in accordance with the above
  goals. Failure to do so risks being delisted by the Network Coordinator.

* The use of the network for illegal purposes is not permitted. Members
  deemed to be engaged in such activities will be delisted by the Network
  Coordinator.

* Real names used in the nodelist, aliases or real names welcome in
  all echoareas.

* Please post messages containing ANSI but do so with an [ANSI] prefix in
  the message subject line. This allows members who can't view ANSI content
  to opt out reading it if they are unable to do so.
  
  e.g. Subject: [ANSI] Something I drew last night
  
* Please do not gate fsxNet traffic to other FTN/QWK networks, Usenet, 
  or any other network without first discussing your request in FSX_GEN
  and obtaining approval from the Zone 21 ZC.  

== Echoareas ================================================================

Message Echos:

FSX_GEN - A general discussion echoarea covering many topics.
          Test messages and other experimentation is welcome. 
	     
FSX_MYS - Mystic BBS discussions, support and development.

FSX_CRY - Cryptographic discussion and experimentation.
          Public key sharing, encoded messages, testing etc.
          is welcome here. 
         
FSX_BOT - The first choice for non-human roBOT output.

          traces of nuts etc. Set your BOT free in this area :)
          
FSX_BBS - BBS software, development and support. The echoarea is also 
          host to fsxNet Wiki (wiki.bbs.nz) discussions and support.
          
FSX_DAT - InterBBS Data. An echomail area used by software such as InterBBS 
          Oneliner or Double-Up (both by Darryl Perry) to send inter-BBS
          data between nodes in fsxNet. In most cases the data is not readable
          or of interest to human eyes. Sysops may wish to hide this echo
          from BBS users.

== Technical Details ========================================================

**** IMPORTANT DETAILS - PLEASE NOTE ****

There are currently four NETs operating in fsxNet each serviced by a HUB.

The fsxNet WHQ HUB (21:1/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
agency.bbs.nz:24556 

The fsxNet Tholian HUB (21:2/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
error404bbs.ddns.net:24555

The fsxNet Mutura HUB (21:3/100) accepts Telnet EMSI/FTS6 + ZedZap connections
via agency.bbs.nz:24558

The fsxNet Niba HUB (21:4/100) accepts BinkD connections via 
bbs.castlerockbbs.com:24560

NOTE: The bbs.nz domain name is now active, previously bbs.geek.nz was 
used. The latter domain will still resolve (for now) but the bbs.nz address 
is preferred. Keep an eye on fsxNet General Chat/Testing echo area (FSX_GEN)
for further info and updates.

Please note the port numbers we're using are in a range from 24555 - 24560
subject to which HUB you are polling.

Please also note when you receive your node number it may likely be in
a different NET than NET 1 so you will possibly need to change both your NET
and NODE number when you obtain your fsxNet address. Along with changing some
address details and session password for the HUB system your BBS is allocated
to poll.

If you are running Mystic BBS please add the IP address 219.89.83.33 and
2001:470:d:123::50 to the WHITELIST.TXT file in your Mystic BBS data 
directory. These are the known IP addresses for the fsxNet HUB in NET1
You may want to add further addresses for other HUBs you connect to in
fsxNet (or othernets / bbs systems) also. You can access this feature via
a text editor from the Mystic configuration menus by typing 
MYSTIC -CFG > Servers > Edit IP Whitelist

Taking this steps ensures that when a fsxNet HUB polls your system it will not
be auto blocked by your Mystic Internet Server if it polls your system 
frequently.

an fsxNet HUB due to any frequent polling (3-4 times in 1 minute) of it 
by your BBS :)

 Static IPv6 Address...........:
 
** If you have a static IP address ** would you like an optional 
custom fsxnet.nz domain name that will resolve to your IP? 
e.g.  mybbsname.fsxnet.nz This gives you another vanity domain name
